Content Sensitivity Detection with BERT

This project contains a BERT-based AI model trained to classify whether a given content is suitable for children or not.
The model predicts if the content should be displayed to children or flagged as inappropriate.
Features

    BERT-based classification: State-of-the-art transformer architecture for text classification.

    Binary output:

        1 → Content NOT suitable for children

        0 → Content suitable for children

    Integrated with HTML UI: Easily use the model via a simple web interface.

    Real-time prediction: Users can input text and get immediate feedback.



Usage

    Clone the repository.

    Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the backend (if applicable) to serve the model API.

    Open the HTML file in your browser.

    Enter your content text and get prediction instantly.
